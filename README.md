## 1 ────୨ৎ──── jay / ioana Ი𐑼

ദ്ദി◝ ⩊ ◜.ᐟ

# hello! im jay (real name ioana. super common romanian name but whatever). you've likely seen me a lot in ponytown ^^. i use she/her, and am apart of many fandoms but only really frequent the bakery area or the fnaf area lel.
i have goldfish cracker memory, so i need to put friend notes often. if i ask you your name and pronouns its exactly for that, so i dont forget you! im usually very sociable and like interacting with people, however i may occasionally put "dniuf" or something in my name. when i do, pls just give me 5 mins break, im just overstimulated/social battery died.
birthday is 12th april, and as i said im 19 and in uni (foreign languages. major is chinese yes we learn chinese).

# ˚₊‧꒰ა ✦ ໒꒱ ‧₊˚ interests ! ꒰ᐢ. .ᐢ꒱
i am a huge lover of **fnaf**, however i play roblox equally, if not more than security breach (600 hours on steam btw). currently hyperfixated on **phigting**, forsaken, die of death, regretevator, blocktales, evade, **bad things**..and just psychological horror as a whole genre, i like creepy games as much as i love comfy wholesome ones.

⋆ ˚｡⋆୨♡୧⋆ ˚｡⋆ will likely add more stuff later when i feel like it.. ˗ˏˋ ★ ˎˊ˗
